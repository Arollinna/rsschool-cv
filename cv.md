## Summary 

Since I work in IT companies as an English teacher, recently I've become interested in learning some programming languages. I found some courses in the Internet, and my friends-programmers are helping me to learn too. One of them adviced me to study in Epam, so I'm here and ready to learn new things. For now I enjoy working with HTML and CSS, and start learning JS. Since I speak English, Spanish and French, I'm sure I'll be successfull in programming languages too. I want to finish this course with you and hope to become a Juniour Dev right after the studies. 

## Skills

I did the course of Yandex Praktikum and some courses of Edx (everything connected with HTML, CSS and JS). 

## Code examples

*For some practice I created a copy of VS Code main page:*

## Experience

I have no working experience, only self-practice which I've described above.
