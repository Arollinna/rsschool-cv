        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Since I work in IT companies as an English teacher, recently I've become interested in learning some programming languages. 
            I found some courses in the Internet, and my friends-programmers are helping me to learn too. 
            One of them adviced me to study in Epam, so I'm here and ready to learn new things. 
            For now I enjoy working with HTML and CSS, and start learning JS. 
            Since I speak English, Spanish and French, I'm sure I'll be successfull in programming languages too, 
            because I figure that the processes of learning foreign and programming languages are quite similar. 
            I want to finish this course with you and hope to become a Juniour Dev right after the studies.</p>
